      (1) Archaeologists used dendrochronology to find the age of the oldest tree in the world.
      (2) Radiometric age determination measures age using the rate of decay for the radioactive isotopes found in organic materials.
      (3) Faunal analysis examines the remains of a species and determines its age based on when other members of the same species existed.
      (4) Radiometric testing is frequently used by archaeologists to determine the age of bones and rocks.
      (5) One method of floral analysis is dendrochronology, which counts the number of growth rings in a tree and compares them to similar trees to estimate the tree's age.
      (6) Faunal association is capable of giving a specific date for when a species existed.""",
